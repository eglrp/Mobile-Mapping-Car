# Mobile-Mapping-Car

## Synopsis

This project was developed for the ITIPJR 2015 course at Aarhus University. Developed and brought to you by a team of developers from different backgrounds, Team One:
- Iñaki Abadía (3rd year Computer Engineering student at Universidad de Zaragoza)
- Roger Prat (4th year Electrical Engineering student at Universidad Politécnica de Cataluña)
- Jaime Escuer (4th year Electronic-Automatic Industrial Engineering student at Universidad de Alcalá)
- Guillaume Trousseau (5th year Computer Engineering student at Institut Supérieur d'Electronique de Paris)

We've built a android-controlled car that's capable of plotting an approximation of the surrounding area. Using 4 ultrasonic sensors we measure the distance from the car to its opposing wall, this sensors are attached to a servo that spinns them to cover all 360º.

## Documentation

We have included 6 documents to help comprehend how the project works:
- **Project_report:** Contains a first approach to the project, we strongly recomend checking this file first. Describes the process we've followed during the development process, figures, use cases, software and hardware diagrams, etc. Sums up all the other documents.
- **Preanalysis_choice_of_components:** Hardware choices explained, microcontroller and sensors.
- **Requeriments_specification:** Goals for this project. What we intended to create, use cases and concept diagram.
- **HW_Architecture_Design:** Hardware architecture and design explained. Pinouts, sensors operation, car steer control diagrams, servo, etc.
- **SW_Architecture_Design:** Software implementation explained. We've used the 4+1 view model.
- **Acceptance_test:** Acceptance tests we ran based on the use cases and the results we obtained.
